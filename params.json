It comes with several output modifiers to modify CSS values, and a plugin that writes processed CSS from the specified chunk to a flat CSS file.\r\n\r\n## Example Use Cases\r\n- Use system or context settings to store primary colors in a site's color scheme, then process all other color values relative to these, so you can shift the entire color theme by modifying a few settings.\r\n- Use in conjunction with ClientConfig to give site owners a nice UI to manage CSS styles---but only the ones you expose, and only in the manner you choose!\r\n- Author MODX \"themes\" that are customizable by the end user.\r\n- Use other MODX tags & placeholders in your CSS - limitless possibilities, \"dynamic CSS\" without performance penalty, because the plugin writes the static CSS file on the Manager Clear Cache and Chunk Save actions, not per request.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nYou can install cssSweet via the MODX Extras Installer. Once installed, you'll have a default Chunk in the \"cssSweet\" category. If you edit that Chunk and click the \"Manage\" Â» \"Clear Cache\" main menu item, a CSS file will be generated for you at \r\n`[[++assets_path]]components/csssweet/csss-custom.css`\r\n\r\nReference this generated CSS file in your template, like this \r\n`<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"[[++assets_path]]components/csssweet/csss-custom.css\">`\r\nand you'll be good to go.\r\n\r\nIn the Plugin properties, you can set the Chunks that you wish to process and include, as well as the filesystem location to which to write the output file.\r\n![Screenshot](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9i5kkcb7k5097pu/Screenshot%202015-04-01%2010.51.16.png?dl=1)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
