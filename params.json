It comes with several \r\noutput modifiers to modify CSS values, and a plugin that writes \r\nprocessed CSS from the specified chunk to a flat CSS file.\r\n\r\nExample Use Cases:\r\n- Use system or context settings to store primary colors in a site's \r\ncolor scheme, then process all other color values relative to these,\r\nso you can shift the entire color theme by modifying a few settings.\r\n- Use in conjunction with ClientConfig to give site owners a nice UI\r\nto manage CSS styles.\r\n- Author MODX \"themes\" that are customizable by the end user.\r\n- Use other MODX tags & placeholders in your CSS - limitless \r\npossibilities, \"dynamic CSS\" without performance penalty, because the\r\nplugin writes the static CSS file on the Manager Clear Cache and\r\nChunk Save actions, not per request.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
